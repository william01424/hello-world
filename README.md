Introduction to using GitHub


Hi everyone!

I graduated from Lancaster University (UK) with a BEng Honours in Chemical Engineering - I now seek to learn how to code and possibly transition into a more software based Engineering role!
At the moment I am studying a course on the fundamentals of Python in my spare time when im not working (full-time employed). I hope to be able to make a version of Snake as a personal poject soon.

Interested in entry level Python projects!!

I am also considering studying for an MSc in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at the end of 2021 - obviously I would need to brush up on some CS concepts and fundamentals!!

Really want to meet some new people in the field and start networking with some people in a similar position to me (or experinced coders looking to mentor someone like me) so please reach out!

Thanks,
Will
