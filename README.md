Introduction to using GitHub


Hi everyone!

I graduated from Lancaster University (UK) with a BEng Honours in Chemical Engineering - I now seek to learn how to code and possibly transition into a more software based Engineering role!
At the moment I am studying a course on the fundamentals of Python in my spare time when im not working.
